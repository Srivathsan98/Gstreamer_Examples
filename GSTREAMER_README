things to note for while wrting a gstreamer code

1. always add the bus_watch_id before starting the main loop
    it is mainly used to check the pipeline added to the bus with a callback function and calls the function whenever a message comes on the bus.
2. if a pad is already linked then we cna just skip past it to unref so better to add the condition to check if it is already linked/not.
